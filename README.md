# Sound Rodeo

A soundboard progressive web app.

## Getting started

### Running the project

However you get the code, you can install dependencies and run the project in development mode with:

```bash
cd soundrodeo
npm install # or yarn
npm run dev
```

Open up [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and start clicking around.

Consult [sapper.svelte.dev](https://sapper.svelte.dev) for help getting started.

## Production mode and deployment

To start a production version of Sound Rodeo, run `npm run build && npm start`. This will disable live reloading, and activate the appropriate bundler plugins.

You can deploy Sound Rodeo to any environment that supports Node 10 or above. As an example, to deploy to [ZEIT Now](https://zeit.co/now) when using `sapper export`, run these commands:

```bash
npm install -g now
now
```
